# Annotation Sources
BioInformatics, and I would say unfortunately, has different nomenclatures
to deal with the genomic information due to different academia. Which is different ways of naming and localising the different genome's elements.
To concieve an idea of this variability here is a web tool in order to transform between different nomenclatures data bases [HGNC-Download](https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/download). 

In order to keep tidy and updated the genomic information needed for the research project/s here I offer a *Downloader.py* script which make use of a JSON file to save and name the URLs. This same JSON file can be updated calling *AnnotsURLsUpdater.py* which will ask for a Name and a URL.

# Genrython

A command line controlled tool to study gene or any other biological elements that have an associated ontology.
The main idea is to develop a tool that let the user to provide any query list or lists and an ontology and recieve as a result an unformatted table with the results.

The tool must evolve as more gene nomenclatures, ontologies and statistics tests are supported. 
The first version should be able to support:

## Ontology
1. Gene Ontology <http://www.geneontology.org/>

## Gene Nomenclature
1. EntrezID (NCBI)

## Statistic
1. Fisher Exact test
